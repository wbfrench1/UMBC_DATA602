### Overview:
<p>This project sought to predict the price of 1985 cars based on a set of common features using a linear regression model.  An interative approach was used to reach the final model.  The following files takes the reader through the process used to create the linear regression model.</p>


### Motivation and Background:
<p> Car shopping is one of the worst experiences people must endure.  Car buying is a classic asymmetric information situation.  Car buyers, who only purchase a car every five to ten years, are pitted against Car salesman, who are well informed about car value and human nature.  The buyer is inundated with a barrage of false information about the value of the car (e.g Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price) and so-called deals ($1,000 cash back today only) and is also subjected of a variety of emotion-twisting sales pitches designed by experts to cause the sale to happen immediately and at the highest possible price.</p>

### Goals:
<p> The goal of this analysis is to bolster the car buyer’s knowledge and blunt the overwhelming advantage car salesman have by allowing the car buyer to predict a car’s price based on its specifications and to build the buyers intuition about which how attributes of a car affect its price.</p>
